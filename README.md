WindEditor
==========

Remade version of WindViewer.

It has a more complete version of a subset of the second [WindViewer](https://github.com/pho/windviewer), which is more broken than the original. I've created a never ending spiral of broken-ness, which is slowly getting better!

There's some [test content to play around with](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/813382/WindViewer_TestContent.7z) floating around on a Dropbox that is not ours. There's a **[release build of our early alpha to play with](https://github.com/LordNed/WindEditor/releases) for those who wish to have a gander.
